jazz sampling / jam sampling


TODO

quick select song library
	possible approaches:
	persist slices. for each song, make a folder in slices, folder is named after the song

fix bug where slider latches and can't get to beginning of song
stereo sampling (pending update to aubiocut)
sustain mode vs mute mode
	mute modes:
	1) full play mute mode (current behaviour). Only stop upon other notes on
	2) Stop sample on assigned note off and other notes on
	3) 
make a pagination setting that fills the entire slider
pagination zoom: dont lose your place when you switch to a higher rez pagination
split midi zones
integrate aubio into puredata
